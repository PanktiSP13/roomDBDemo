# Room Database Demo in Kotlin

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive example of implementing a Room Database in an Android application using modern Android development practices. The project showcases CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, version migration, and integration of key components such as MVVM architecture, Hilt dependency injection, LiveData, and Kotlin Flow.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with a Room Database.
- MVVM architecture for organized and maintainable code.
- Hilt for efficient dependency injection.
- LiveData for observing and reacting to data changes.
- Kotlin Flow for asynchronous and reactive programming.
- Data version migration to handle schema changes gracefully.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PanktiSP13/roomDBDemo.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

## Usage

Explore the app to understand how Room Database works with MVVM architecture, Hilt, LiveData, and Kotlin Flow. The app allows you to perform CRUD operations on user data, demonstrating how these components interact harmoniously to provide a seamless user experience.

You can also examine the implementation details of the different components within the app's codebase to learn how to incorporate them into your own projects.
